# Open Comms - A platform for communication

## Arcadium & Elementarius

Open Comms is connected to the Arcadium entertainment platform and [Elementarius](https://github.com/dgoldman0/arcadium-main/blob/master/elementarius.md). And while Open Comms is a general purpose social media platform, it takes place within the world of Elementarius, and so the focus is on entertainment.

## User Accounts

User accounts need mana crystals in order to activate their accounts. Mana will also be needed in order to create energy that user activities will consume. One reason why mana crystals are required is to prevent people from creating a large number of dummy accounts. While mana crystals can easily be obtained from the market, or from some free-to-earn play in Elementarius, it still would be a waste of money to create accounts just to spam.

### Stats

Users will be able to keep track of numerous stats including their reach for both transmissions and logs.

## Locations

Open Comms is a virtual space, and users  exist at specific locations in that space. As more users register, the space itself expands (the world will grow in size), causing people to spread out more. However, users are not forced to stay in place. They can move locations. However, energy will be consumed in moving from one location to another.

The further away a user wants to move from their current location, the more energy it costs. However, less populated locations will cost less to move to than heavily populated areas.

## Transmissions vs Logs

There are two different media types in Open Comms, the transmission and the log. The transmission is a short lived post, which is distributed to other people nearby, while a log is persistent.

### Transmissions

As already stated, transmissions are short duration communications. They're sent out at the center of where the user is currently located. The radius of transmission is determined by how much energy a user is willing to use. The more energy used, the greater the initial potential reach. However, the greater the distance, the more expensive it becomes, and the amount of energy required to send a message to the entire world becomes infinite. This system limits reach and prevents spamming of messages "across the globe."

#### Boosts

Transmissions can be boosted by other users who want to see the transmission continue longer. A boost is just like a regular transmission, except that it contains the path information to the original sender.

#### "Beacon" Transmissions

A user can self boost a transmission, setting it to stay alive even after it would otherwise die out. An account that is set up to continuously transmit a message is called a beacon.

#### Relay Stations

Similar to beacons, a relay station can be used to extend the reach of transmissions. A relay may boost transmissions from specific users, based on specific keywords, or through a number of other predefined criteria.

### Logs

Transmissions are fun if a user wants to send out a quick message to a lot of people. But for longer posts that anyone can review for as long as they want, users may be more interested in setting up logs. A log is a persistent block of information that contain numerous data types, including text and images.

#### Private and Subscription Based Logs

Not all logs are for public consumption. Logs can be made private, accessible to only specific users, or even made accessible through subscriptions, also payable in energy.
Public logs will be accessible to everyone to read, even without an account.
