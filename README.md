# Open Comms - A platform for communication

## Arcadium & Elementarius

Open Comms is connected to the Arcadium entertainment platform and Elementarius. While Open Comms is a general purpose social media platform, the focus is on entertainment, and so most posts will likely be entertainment related.

## User Accounts

User accounts need mana crystals in order to activate their accounts. Mana will also be needed in order to create energy that user activities will consume.

### Locations

Open Comms is a virtual 3D space, and users will exist at specific locations in that space. As more users register, the space itself will expand, allowing people to spread out more. Energy will be consumed in moving from one location to another.

### Stats

Users will be able to keep track of numerous stats including their reach for both transmissions and logs.

## Transmissions vs Logs

There are two different media types in Open Comms, the transmission and the log. The transmission is a short lived post, which is distributed to other people nearby, while a log is persistent.

### Transmissions

As already stated, transmissions are short duration communications. They're sent out at the center of where the user is currently located. The radius of transmission is determined by how much energy a user is willing to use. The more energy used, the greater the initial potential reach.

#### Boosts

Transmissions can be boosted by other users who want to see the transmission continue longer. A boost is just like a regular transmission, except that it contains the path information to the original sender.

### Logs

Transmissions are fun if a user wants to send out a quick message to a lot of people. But for longer posts that anyone can review for as long as they want, users may be more interested in setting up logs. A log is a persistent block of information that contain numerous data types, including text and images.

#### Private and Subscription Based Logs

Not all logs are for public consumption. Logs can be made private, accessible to only specific users, or even made accessible through subscriptions.
